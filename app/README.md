## Welcome to TDD Mukayese

For submitting a new task follow these steps:

- Go to this [Github repository] and create a new markdown file (<file-name>.md), this file should contain the new tasks details that are going to be displayed at the website  
- after that navigate to [this JSON file] and add a new object to the array, the object for the new task should contain title, short description, url to the file created in the previous step and an id which is a v4 UUID, you can generate V4 UUID using this [generator]

 Once the changes have been committed, the newly added task should be accessable from the website.
